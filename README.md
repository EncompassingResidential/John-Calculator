This is a Calculator App with basic calculation features.
Sorry desktop users, no keyboard entry at this time, only mouse.

This is the 3rd project created for Software Developer Mastermind (SDMM).

Go to this www to get the source code:
https://github.com/EncompassingResidential/John-Calculator.git

Run the project at: https://encompassingresidential.github.io/John-Calculator/

App Should look like this:

Feature clarification:

Currently this calculator does not follow operator precedence when doing a multiple operator sequence.
This calculator: 4 + 8 / 2 = 6  brownDown(4 + 8 = 12 / 2 = 6)
Calculator follow operator precedence: 4 + 8 / 2 = 8  brokenDown(8 / 2 = 4 + 4 = 8 due to divison and multiplication are done before Addition and Subtraction operations)

This was started on 1/16/22, but main push started on 2/02/2022 
and fully completed on 2/11/2022 at around 4 to 5 focused in depth hours a day execept weekends. 40 hours on the nose.

Deliverables for this Calculator

A user can add two numbers together:
+  1 + 1 = 2
+  11 + 2 = 13
+  11 + 22 = 33

Subtract two numbers
+  3 - 2 = 1
+  33 - 2 = 31
+  33 - 22 = 11
+  22 - 33 = -11

Multiply two numbers
+  2 x 3 = 6
+  22 x 3 = 66
+  22 x 33 = 726

Divide two numbers
+  6 / 3 = 2
+  66 / 3 = 22
+  66 / 33 = 2
+  10 / 3 = 3.3333
+  10 / 4 = 1.5 wrong (actual answer is 2.5)

+ Display at least 10 digits on the screen
+ Display decimals to at least the thousandth (.001)
+ on results and calculator history

Perform continuous functions:
+  1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4
+  1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10
+  11 + 22 + 33 + 44 + 55 = 165
+  100 - 50 - 20 - 10 = 20
+  2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120

+  22 * 33 * 44 = 31,944
+  100 / 5 / 4 = 5
+  1000 / 50 / 10 = 2
+  100 / 5 / 4 / 2 = 2.5
+  4 + 3 * 7 - 14 / 7 = 5 (doesn't have to hold to operator precedence. Thank You says this developer.

If operator precedence was held to then:
4 + (3 * 7 = 21) means 4 + 21 means 25 - (14 / 7 = 2) means 25 - 2 = 23

+ Pressing the clear button resets screen to 0

Optional added features:
+ Added Calculation history
+ Added +/-


Possible future feature additions
Add Clear History button which clears on screen Calculator History and also Local Storage
Add a memory save   button (M+)
Add a memory clear  button (M-)
Add a memory recall button (MR)

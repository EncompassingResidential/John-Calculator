Deliverables
Cross off each one you have completed

A user can add two numbers together:
● +       1 + 1 = 2
● +       11 + 2 = 13
● +       11 + 22 = 33

Subtract two numbers
● +       3 - 2 = 1
● +       33 - 2 = 31
● +       33 - 22 = 11
● +       22 - 33 = -11

Multiply two numbers
● +       2 x 3 = 6
● +       22 x 3 = 66
● +       22 x 33 = 726

Divide two numbers
● +       6 / 3 = 2
● +       66 / 3 = 22
● +       66 / 33 = 2
● +       10 / 3 = 3.3333
● +       10 / 4 = 1.5 wrong (actual answer is 2.5)

+ Display at least 10 digits on the screen

Display decimals to at least the thousandth (.001)
+ on results and calculator history

-----  "needs this" on being able to enter in floating

Needs on - Perform continuous functions:
● +       1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4
● +       1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10
● +       11 + 22 + 33 + 44 + 55 = 165
● +       100 - 50 - 20 - 10 = 20
● +       2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120
● + except no comma       22 * 33 * 44 = 31,944
● +       100 / 5 / 4 = 5
● +       1000 / 50 / 10 = 2
● +       100 / 5 / 4 / 2 = 2.5
● +       4 + 3 * 7 - 14 / 7 = 5 (not holding to operator precedence, Thank You.)

if operator precedence was held to then:
4 + (3 * 7 = 21) means 4 + 21 means 25 - (14 / 7 = 2) means 25 - 2 = 23

+ Pressing the clear button resets screen to 0

Optional:
I added:
+ Calculation history

Now my = button is over writting Calculator History even in Local Storage.
It is after I did a multiple Operand Operation.

+ , to results / Sum
+ History when % is pressed (and I think I have to clear RightOperand due to my logic)
+ ohh, he didn't say max 3 digits after . period he stated at least 3 digits after the decimal period.

Ghost these out if not going to do
+ period '.' button
+ fixed if initial button is a '.' button

Maybe add check for two periods in a row...

+ Add +/-

Maybe add Clear History button which clears Local Storage

He said I don't have to add these since I did calculator history
●        Add a memory save button (M+)
●        Add a memory clear button (M-)
●        Add a memory recall button (MR)
